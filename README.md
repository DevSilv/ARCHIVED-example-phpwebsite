# silvuss-example-phpwebsite

This repository contains my second GitHub project – just a simple example website, written mostly in PHP and JavaScript.

**Read before use:** This website **is not** intended to be used according to the purpose described above. You may use it **only** to test whether the code is written the way it is expected to be (i.e. it produces expected results) and **only** when you know what the code will really do. For details, see the section "[Disclaimers](#disclaimers)" of this README.

## Copyright note

Note that this "silvuss-example-phpwebsite" project (this repository) has currently **no license**, as explained in [this GitHub guide on licensing projects](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).

For your convenience, I am including below a quote from that site:

> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

Also note that I can add a lincese in the future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## Disclaimers

**This website is an example website that is not intended to be used.** Its purpose is only to show code that is known to work. While probably nothing dangerous would happen, you may run it only under your own responsibility.

Although I have made efforts to make it work as intended and described, it is not a "proffessional" website. Specifically, it was not tested in terms of separate unit tests or similar. It was tested to build and work on only one platform. For details on the platform, see the section "[Environment, tools and technologies used](#environment-tools-and-technologies-used)" of this README.

## How to install this website?

Simply put, one can see how the website looks and works by:
1. Copying its files to a server's main directory; the server should support [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) of version 7.1.16 (optimal) or greater;
2. Setting appropriate paths, especially the `index.php` file as the main file (it's located in website's main directory);
3. Navigating to `localhost`, `localhost/index.php` or some other similar address in their browser.

## Environment, tools and technologies used

This website is created in the following technologies:
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), version 5
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), version 3
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) – [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), version most probably not above 6
- [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), version 7.1.16
