# silvuss-website-1
my second github project – just an example website

## copyright note
note that this "silvuss-website-1" (this project) has **currently no license**, as explained here: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/.

for your convenience i am including below a quote from that site:
> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

also note that i can **add a lincese** in the near future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## installation and usage
simply put, you can see how the site looks and works by:
1. copying its files to a server's main directory; the server should support php of version 7.1.16 (optimal) or greater;
2. setting appropriate paths, especially the `index.php` file as the main file (it's located in site's main directory);
3. navigating to `localhost`, `localhost/index.php` or some other similar address in your browser.

## technologies used
there are **currently** following technologies used in this project:
* html 5
* css 3
* javascript – ecmascript version: 6
* php 7.1.16

## updates of the information in this file
i will **try to remember** to update this readme.md file if anything will change. :)
