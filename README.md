# silvuss-example-phpwebsite
My second GitHub project – just an example website, written in PHP and JavaScript.

## Copyright note
Note that this "silvuss-example-phpwebsite" (this project) has **currently no license**, as explained here: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/.

For your convenience, I am including below a quote from that site:
> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

Also note that I can add a lincese in the near future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## Installation and usage
Simply put, you can see how the site looks and works by:
1. Copying its files to a server's main directory; the server should support php of version 7.1.16 (optimal) or greater;
2. Setting appropriate paths, especially the `index.php` file as the main file (it's located in site's main directory);
3. Navigating to `localhost`, `localhost/index.php` or some other similar address in your browser.

## Tools and technologies used
The following technologies are used in this project:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
